The Stopwatch project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, tracks time intervals with Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset functions. It updates in real time, displaying hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. With a sleek, responsive design, it's both practical for tasks and an excellent learning project for mastering JavaScript timing and events.
